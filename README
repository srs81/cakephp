This is a local, heavily modified version of CakePHP 2.1.1 customized for my own use. You may not be able to build systems using this fork without a custom application-specific script (which I have and hope to release soon.) 

The biggest changes are in the template files, but also in the bundled plugins that are also part of the template.

The modifications were originally made to CakePHP 2.0.6, and then merged with 2.1.1 to produce this current release (March 2012).
