WARNING: This is a local, modified version of CakePHP 2.1.1 customized for my own use. You may not be able to build systems using this without a custom script (which I hope to release soon.) 

The biggest changes are in the template files, but also in the bundled plugins that are also part of the template.

The modifications were originally made to CakePHP 2.0.6, and then merged with 2.1.1 to produce this.

============================

CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC. Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.
